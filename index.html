                <p>
                    My project aims to tell the story of a frustrated artist navigating the struggles of creativity. I
                    initially explored AI tools like DALL·E and Ideogram for character creation and scene design, but
                    while these platforms generated visually appealing images, they lacked consistency in the artist's
                    appearance across poses and settings. This limitation led me to train a LoRA model in FluxGym to
                    achieve a unified protagonist and adapt workflows in ComfyUI to blend LoRA-based character
                    generation with fixed background images. Additional tools like Photoshop Beta AI for fine-tuning,
                    Tensorpix for quality enhancement and a GPT-trained film director for scene planning further shaped
                    the project. KlingAI became my main tool for animating still images into cohesive video scenes.

                <p> <strong>Early Explorations <br /><br /></strong>The project began with a broad exploration of visual
                    concepts using tools like DALL·E and Ideogram.
                    These platforms laid the foundation for early ideation, helping to envision the protagonist and
                    potential scenes. However, their inability to maintain visual consistency became a significant
                    barrier.

                <p>I also experimented with Hailou AI for video generation, using techniques that relied on prompts and
                    pre-generated images. This helped me understand AI's video capabilities, though the outputs were
                    limited by poor quality and short durations. Key lessons included the importance of character
                    consistency and generating clips in 16:9 film dimensions for a cinematic look.

                <p><strong>Transition to ComfyUI <br /><br /></strong>Recognising the need for greater control, I
                    transitioned to ComfyUI, a node-based interface for
                    AI-generated content. ComfyUI allowed me to connect nodes for specific functions like character
                    generation and background integration. This modular approach enabled me to test workflows for
                    character-to-background combinations, storyboarding and video-to-video techniques. While flexible,
                    these workflows often struggled with maintaining character consistency, especially when dealing with
                    complex backgrounds or dynamic poses.

                <h2>Development Process</h2>
                <p> <strong>Developing the Character</strong> <br /><br />
                    To ensure character consistency, I created "Dana's Film Assistant," a GPT-based AI trained on
                    cinematic storytelling. Inspired by directors like Damien Chazelle, it provided insights into scene
                    structure, character arcs, and visual depth.
                    <br /><br />
                    Achieving a cohesive character design required significant experimentation. Initially, I attempted
                    to generate individual images with consistent facial features and manually adjust poses using
                    Openpose models. However, this approach proved both time-consuming and inconsistent. Instead, I
                    trained a LoRA model, 'Frankai,' in FluxGym using a dataset of 16 diverse images. When incorporated
                    into ComfyUI workflows, this model ensured consistency across varying poses and settings by
                    triggering its characteristics through its name.

                    <strong>Creating Scenes</strong><br /><br />Using ComfyUI, I generated environments with a LoRA-only
                    workflow,
                    refining them in Photoshop Beta to establish scene foundations. I then transitioned to a
                    dual-conditioning workflow, combining the LoRA character with the background. Balancing the "noise"
                    parameter was critical—higher noise produced detailed environments but omitted the character, while
                    lower noise prioritised the character at the expense of environmental accuracy. Experimenting with
                    these parameters and seed values (which ensure reproducibility) helped achieve balanced results.
                    <br /><br />For further refinement, I used Photoshop Beta to tweak hair, add artistic elements like
                    paintbrushes, and enhance textures, ensuring alignment with my vision. <br /><br />The trained movie
                    director GPT not only refined prompt wording but also guided the ideation process for structuring
                    and planning the film. It suggested atmospheric scenes of the room without the protagonist to
                    establish the setting, which I incorporated in later close-up videos. Additionally, it provided
                    insights into camera movements, such as when to use close-ups, wide shots, zoom-ins, and the ideal
                    duration of each shot for a more cinematic effect.

                    <strong>Video Creation</strong><br /><br />For video generation, KlingAI's features, including
                    prompt-based generation, photo-to-video transformations, and the elements tool, allowed for
                    interactive scenes combining characters, backgrounds and objects. However, character poses from
                    input images heavily influenced animations, often resulting in unnatural movements. Careful planning
                    was needed to address this limitation.

                            The first scene introduces the protagonist in a cluttered studio, reflecting his creative
                            struggles. Using AI tools, I generated various angles and enhanced the visuals with light
                            grain to unify the aesthetic, including atmospheric shots of the
                            room to set the mood.

                <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
                <p>A key ethical issue I encountered during this project was the pervasive presence of stereotypes and
                    bias in AI-generated content. While the LoRA model I trained for my protagonist ensured consistency,
                    its limitations highlighted broader issues in AI datasets. For example, the model was trained on a
                    white male character, which influenced not only the protagonist’s appearance but also the
                    surrounding cast. Men were generated far more often than women and when women did appear, they were
                    often depicted with distorted features, leaving me questioning whether this bias stemmed from the
                    LoRA model itself or deeper flaws in the AI training datasets. <br /><br />
                    This bias extended beyond character representation. While generating scenes in a European setting,
                    prompts involving "neon lights at night" often included signs in Asian scripts, even though the
                    environment had no cultural connection to Asia. Similarly, people of colour were rarely generated
                    unless explicitly specified. At first, I was impressed when the AI included people of colour in an
                    urban graffiti street, but later, upon deeper reflection, I realised this felt less like inclusivity
                    and more like a reflection of bias in associating certain demographics with specific environments.
                    Gender-based stereotypes also became apparent in wardrobe choices. When generating people in formal
                    attire, men were consistently dressed in tuxedos or suits, while women appeared almost exclusively
                    in red dresses, reinforcing outdated norms about gender roles.<br /><br />
                    These patterns emphasise the importance of holding AI developers accountable for ensuring diverse,
                    unbiased datasets. Representation in AI-generated content isn't just about aesthetics, it has
                    real-world implications for how technology perpetuates stereotypes and impacts society’s perception
                    of identity and inclusivity. This project underscored the urgent need for ethical oversight in AI,
                    especially when dealing with human representation.</p>

                <h2>Research & Reflection</h2>
                <p>This project was a deep dive into how AI and machine learning can enhance and reshape the creative
                    process. Tools like ComfyUI, Photoshop Beta, and KlingAI allowed me to experiment with storytelling,
                    visuals and animations in ways that would be impossible on a small budget. Photoshop Beta, with its
                    hands-on approach, enabled precise edits, letting me fine-tune specific elements like colours or
                    composition without regenerating entire scenes. ComfyUI’s node-based workflows allowed for a modular
                    process where I could focus on balancing character consistency and background integration
                    effectively. <br /><br />
                    Yet, the process wasn’t without challenges. AI-generated ideas for the film’s plot were often too
                    generic, with predictable twists like “it was all a dream” or “he was dead the whole time.” This
                    required human intervention to develop a more layered and original narrative. Visuals, too, demanded
                    careful curation, out of several generated videos, only one or two were usable and even these
                    required speed adjustments and editing to meet aesthetic and narrative goals.<br /><br />
                    The unpredictability of AI brought both frustrations and surprises. For instance, I imagined the
                    protagonist sitting still in a café, but AI unexpectedly added him sipping coffee and sketching, a
                    detail that elevated the scene’s depth. However, AI’s literal interpretation of prompts often posed
                    issues; for example, asking for a "wobbly" motion caused objects to move unnaturally. I learned that
                    negative prompts and weighting techniques became essential for guiding the AI
                    effectively.<br /><br />

                    This project reaffirmed that while AI is a powerful tool for ideation and execution, the human touch
                    remains essential. Maintaining cohesion, refining ideas and creating a narrative that resonates
                    emotionally requires oversight that AI alone, at this stage, can’t provide. Despite its limitations,
                    the process was highly rewarding, showcasing AI’s ability to accelerate workflows and inspire
                    creativity. Ultimately, this project underscored the evolving partnership between human creativity
                    and technology in artistic fields.
